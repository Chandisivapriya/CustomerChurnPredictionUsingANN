# CustomerChurnPredictionUsingANN
Customer churn prediction helps businesses identify which customers are likely to leave. Using Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), a machine learning technique, we can predict churn by analyzing patterns in customer data. This project shows how to implement an ANN model to predict customer churn and improve business retention strategies.

2. Key Concepts & Definitions 📚
✅ Customer Churn: The rate at which customers stop doing business with a company. Churn prediction aims to forecast which customers are at risk of leaving.

✅ Artificial Neural Networks (ANN): A machine learning model inspired by the brain’s neural structure. ANN uses layers of interconnected “neurons” to learn and make predictions based on data.

✅ Dataset: A collection of data points used for training a model. In this project, the dataset includes customer features such as age, contract type, and customer behavior.

✅ Classification: The task of predicting a category (e.g., whether a customer will churn or not) based on input data.

3. Step-by-Step Explanation 📝
Step 1: Data Collection 💾

Download the dataset from Kaggle (link below).
Dataset Example: Customer attributes like tenure, age, product usage, etc.
Step 2: Data Preprocessing 🔧

Handle missing values.
Convert categorical data to numeric (e.g., using one-hot encoding).
Normalize numerical features (scaling) for better ANN performance.
Step 3: Split the Data 🔀

Divide the dataset into training (80%) and testing (20%) sets.
Step 4: Build the ANN Model 🧠

Define the model architecture (input, hidden layers, output).
Use relu for hidden layers and sigmoid for output (binary classification).
Step 5: Train the Model 🏋️‍♂️

Use the training set to teach the model patterns.
Optimize with an appropriate loss function (binary crossentropy) and optimizer (Adam).
Step 6: Evaluate the Model 🏅

Assess performance using the test data.
Calculate accuracy, precision, recall, or F1-score.
Step 7: Make Predictions 🔮

Use the trained model to predict customer churn on unseen data.
