# CustomerChurnPredictionUsingANN
Customer churn prediction helps businesses identify which customers are likely to leave. Using Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), a machine learning technique, we can predict churn by analyzing patterns in customer data. This project shows how to implement an ANN model to predict customer churn and improve business retention strategies.
